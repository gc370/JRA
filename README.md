So far, we have several methods for solving first order ODE's, currently programmged for functions of x and t with x' being the DE.

If interested, couple of teething problems are functions that involve/ have either x or t in the name.

For example, exp or tan produces errors, check the first few lines of each and you will see how I have paramaterised my function for recursion (ugly yes I know) hopefully you can show me a better way.

Let me know what you think so far.
